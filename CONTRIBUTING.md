# Contributing to Thermite

Thermite can be used through a prebuilt runtime package or a source checkout.
Engine improvements belong in a separate source checkout. Human and
agent-authored pull requests are welcome: fix bugs you encounter, clarify
confusing instructions, improve rendering, or add carefully sourced components.
Small, focused contributions are useful; you do not need to wait for a large
feature to be finished.

The alpha is developed from source using Bun 1.4.2 (pinned in `.bun-version`)
on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Install Python 3.12 or later for the full development
checks (`python` on Windows, `python3` elsewhere, or set
`THERMITE_RESEARCH_PYTHON`). Runtime users do not need Python. See
[platform checks](docs/platforms.md). Clone this repository, run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`,
then `bun run build`. Use `bun thermite.mjs` from the checkout. For a quick
feedback loop, run `bun run test -- <affected test file>` (not `bun test`; the
suite runs on Vitest); run `bun run check` before submitting a change. Commit
`bun.lock` changes with any dependency change; `package-lock.json` is retained
only for the frozen historical private release tooling.

This project is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Before your
first pull request is merged, sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md)
by adding this line to the pull request description:

```text
I have read the CLA document and I hereby sign the CLA.
```

The human contributor must read and accept the CLA. Agents may prepare changes
and a PR description, but must not insert an acceptance statement or represent
that they have signed for someone else. Maintainers verify acceptance before
merging; the PR template alone is not a signature.

You keep the copyright in your contributions; the CLA is a licence, not an
assignment. Add a sign-off with `git commit -s` so each commit carries a
`Signed-off-by` trailer using your real name and email in your Git configuration.
This is a commit sign-off, not a cryptographic signature or a substitute for
CLA acceptance.
If you are contributing on behalf of a company that holds rights in the work,
contact the maintainers first so a corporate
agreement can be put in place. Start with an
[issue requesting contributor contact](https://github.com/BlackettApplied/ThermiteSchematics/issues/new)
to arrange that conversation; do not include confidential agreement details.

## From local fix to pull request

1. Fork [BlackettApplied/ThermiteSchematics](https://github.com/BlackettApplied/ThermiteSchematics)
   and create a focused branch in your engine checkout. The current upstream
   default branch is `dev`; target that branch when opening the PR.
2. Reproduce the issue with shareable input, make the change, and run focused
   tests. Run `bun run check` before submitting. Rebuild before using the changed
   engine to generate your project's drawings.
3. Review the diff, sign off your commits, and push your branch to your fork.
   Open a PR describing the problem, resulting behavior, validation, and any
   remaining limitations. Identify agent assistance and third-party sources.
4. Review and accept the CLA yourself when applicable, then respond to review.
   If your agent lacks GitHub access, it can leave the patch and PR description
   ready for you to submit.

Use a small synthetic example instead of customer drawings, credentials, or
proprietary machine data. Report reproducible issues even if you cannot fix them.
When an agent finds a related improvement, keep unrelated work in a separate PR.

## Make a reviewable change

Create a branch for one concrete problem. Include a minimal electrical JSON
example that reproduces it, the expected behavior, the implementation, and
focused verification. Generated SVG/HTML is evidence, never electrical source.
Keep source JSON and library documentation reviewable in the pull request.
Agents can use the same workflow; the human submitting a change remains
responsible for its engineering assumptions.

Avoid mixing engine changes with a machine project's electrical modifications.
A source checkout under `tools/thermite` can be its own Git repository or a pinned
submodule. Commit and submit engine changes there; keep machine design history
in the parent project. Do not automatically update that project's pinned engine.

## Electrical semantics

Preserve UUID identity, precise diagnostics, strict UTF-8/duplicate-key handling,
library byte locks, and deterministic net IDs. Only wires, jumpers, and cable
cores terminated at both ends join physical nets. A contact, coil, PLC channel,
or other device function does not automatically short its terminals. Internal
functions can describe behavior without asserting physical continuity.

Use the guarded patch workflow for existing project source and presentation:
validate, inspect, dry-run, apply, validate, render. The
[agent request reference](docs/agent-requests.md) contains executable examples.
Preserve diagnostics and separate result/report streams. Never infer an
electrical repair from a layout problem. Test negative cases whenever changing
connectivity or validation.

## Rendering

ELK owns placement and orthogonal routing; the catalog owns symbol primitives.
Sheet composition adds physical paper, title blocks, and continuation references.
Keep these concerns distinct. Preserve the original continuous SVG contract.

Inspect rendered output at its intended print size. Check cabinet names,
terminal numbers, wire labels, crossings/junctions, conductor continuations,
spare ends, and title blocks. Do not hide clipping with a smaller font or omit
conductors to make a test pass. A safe, explained R006 failure is preferable to
an incomplete drawing. Confirm both drawing flows for layout changes.

## Component library submissions

Libraries are ordinary JSON directories with `library.json` and declared type
source files. The included core library is generic, not manufacturer-certified.
A new manufacturer type should include:

- Manufacturer, exact part/order number, and hardware/document revision.
- Official source document URL, document title, and page references.
- Explicit terminal identifiers and ratings with their units.
- Function and symbol mappings with a minimal valid wiring example.
- Notes separating verified facts from unsupported or unmodeled features.
- A complete inventory of power, return, protective bonding, shield, signal and communication connections, including optional pins.
- Explicit `required: true` on universally required terminals/ports, and `connectionCoverage` with review notes. Mark incomplete models `partial`; do not claim complete coverage for a port-only device. Reviewed abstract interfaces without exact-part catalog facts may use `generic`; a model missing part of its own interface remains `partial`. See [connection completeness](docs/completeness.md).

Do not copy a manufacturer's complete manual into the repository without the
necessary permission. Do not extrapolate one part's pinout to a product family.
New component IDs need renderer mappings as well as electrical definitions;
a valid library schema alone does not establish render support.

After intentional library edits, regenerate the project lock and validate.
The Siemens pilot covers selected S7-1200, ET 200SP and Comfort Panel order
numbers, with separate wiring examples for the reference-machine candidates.
Extend this through individually sourced part reviews; support for other family
members is not implied by those definitions. See the library README for the
current inventory and the limits of each model.

## Checks and releases

The normal check is the cross-platform source-alpha development check.
Source engine instructions live in the compact [root guide](AGENTS.md).
Keep historical private release controls intact. The normal check excludes the
historical `release-package.test.ts` inventory suite and does not assert protected
release-evidence audits.
Source archives are verified separately by extracting, installing, building, and
running the alpha CLI. Historical checks and former guide context are preserved
in the [source development archive](docs/legacy/source-development-context.md).

Run `bun run package:pack` from a clean committed tree to build and verify the
public runtime ZIP, or add `--preview` for an uncommitted local test build.
See the [runtime packaging guide](docs/runtime-package.md) and
[platform checks](docs/platforms.md) for packaging, acceptance, and verified
targets. Workspace packages
remain `private: true` to prevent accidental npm publication; that flag does not
restrict the source license.

Do not publish a package, change repository
visibility, select a license, or upload machine-project data as part of a routine
fix. Every release should identify the exact commit and supported runtime.

`bun scripts/check-worktree.mjs` reproduces the linked-worktree CI step locally.
It installs and checks committed `HEAD`; it does not copy uncommitted edits.

### Documentation index and checks

`bun run check:docs` checks the generated [documentation index](docs/README.md),
local links and fragments, guide topics, source-document navigation and legacy
instructions. It runs after `check:health` in `bun run check` and makes no edits.
After adding, removing or renaming a Markdown source, changing its H1, or editing
`docs/topics.json`, run `bun scripts/docs-index.mjs --write` and inspect the diff.
The default `bun scripts/docs-index.mjs` (or `--check`) only checks freshness.
After any Markdown change, run `bun scripts/docs-index.mjs --check` and regenerate
if stale. Rebased branches follow the same check, including changes to an H1.

The inventory includes unstaged source Markdown and works without Git in source
archives. `scripts/docs-policy.json` defines groups and narrow exclusions for
build output and process artifacts; it is not a document allowlist. Library,
research, evaluation, tooling, fixture and archive links are inside expandable
groups. Every source document must have an inbound link and be within two links
of the root README. Planning links cannot satisfy either rule. Code and unused
reference definitions are not navigation; external URLs are not fetched.
Non-Markdown assets need an existing local target.
Links into excluded paths fail even when the target exists. When Git is available,
Git-ignored targets also fail; tracked documents hidden by policy are findings.
`file://` URLs fail because they do not identify portable repository paths.
Findings are sorted as `file:line target reason`; exits are 0 (clean), 1
(findings), and 2 (tool failure). Both scripts accept `--root <directory>` for
checking a separate source tree.

`check:docs` also checks the [runnable-example inventory](scripts/docs-examples.json).
It covers every code block in the root README and indexed live `docs/`, excluding
the archive and planning. All languages are inventoried, including diagrams and
fragments. Entries use the file path and a SHA-256 of language, metadata and body;
moving a fence down the page does not invalidate it. Each entry is executed,
illustrative with a reason, or limited to a named platform/setup with a reason.
Freshness checks run no examples. The test suite executes current Markdown bodies
in temporary projects. Existing topic examples name their exact test, pin its
source bytes, and require evidence that the test parser consumed the selected
fence hash. A passing test that omitted that fence cannot approve it.

After changing a fence, use `bun scripts/docs-examples.mjs --help` to choose its
classification. For example, `bun scripts/docs-examples.mjs --classify README.md#4 --as executed --recipe repo-shell`
runs that recipe before recording the current hash; a failed run leaves the
inventory untouched. Use the recipe already named by the reviewed entry when
updating it. Illustrative entries require `--reason`; platform entries also need
`--setup`. Inspect the inventory diff. `bun scripts/docs-examples.mjs --measure`
prints counts by file and language. No bulk updater silently approves examples.
Child commands close unused stdin and have deadlines (30 seconds for recipe
commands, 120 seconds for bound tests). Teardown kills and awaits owned children
before removing their temporary files; bound-test scratch files also live under
the owned temporary directory.

Historical runtime and installation instructions belong in `docs/legacy/`.
The scan checks configured old-runtime phrases in live prose and code, joining
shell continuations before checking. `scripts/docs-policy.json` has an empty
legacy baseline. Only that archive and the SHA-protected frozen CLI
`assets/AGENTS.md` are exempt from legacy prose checks; both remain in the
inventory and link checks. Live
factual archive pointers and electrical uses of “legacy” remain valid.

### Focused tests and timings

Build after source edits: several suites execute `dist/`. Use Vitest through the
wrapper, with `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=2` on shared machines. `bun run test:catalog`
lists files by package, typical file wall times and coverage, including the named
catalog and research suites. Set `THERMITE_TEST_TIMINGS=1` on `bun run test` or
`bun run check` to write Vitest's per-file start/end intervals and assertion
results to `coverage/test-timings.json` (ignored, overwritten on each run).
Intervals overlap across workers; they are not additive check wall time. Delete
that report after taking measurements.

### Golden and generated-fixture map

Rebuild first. Update only the set you own, inspect every diff, and check it
again. Other sets have no automatic updater; never regenerate unrelated goldens
to silence a failure. Rendering changes also need print-size review in both flows.

### Health budgets

`bun run check:health` runs the deterministic AST ratchet in `bun run check`.
Global ceilings are 3,000 physical lines per file and 300 per function. They,
and the total non-null assertion and test suppression ceilings, never rise.
The outlier thresholds remain 850 file lines and 70 function lines. Against dev,
crossing a threshold or growing an entry requires an exact reviewed reason.
Release targets enforce the hard invariants without recomposing per-item reasons
from earlier dev PRs. Active grandfathered over-cap items only fall under content
continuity. `health:accept` cannot waive hard invariants against either target.

Coverage defaults to **all tracked code** (`js/mjs/cjs/jsx`, `ts/mts/cts/tsx`,
Python, shell and PowerShell), including package fixtures, generators, examples
and new directories. The explicit generated-code exclusions are
`packages/schema/src/generated/**` and `packages/render/src/text-metrics-data.ts`.
JSON/data and signed evidence are not code; pure literal-data modules in
fixtures/goldens/snapshots are excluded by AST inspection. Directory names alone
do not exclude code helpers. `evals/agent` is frozen to E2's harness: its existing
tracked-test suppression scan stays, but its sizes are excluded pending a separate
versioned harness-equivalence change. Test sizes count; only direct
`describe`/`suite` grouping callbacks in test files are excluded (including
`.only`, `.each(...)` and other suite modifiers, not arbitrary chained calls).
Their nested `it`/`test` bodies, hooks and helpers count. Non-null/duplicate counts
cover production/scripts; tests and fixture code count suppressions, not assertions
or duplicate bodies. Duplicate bodies count at 50 normalized AST tokens.

Only Git-tracked files are scanned; run at the checkout root. Use `git add -N`
for new files; omitted untracked code produces a warning. Lines split on CRLF,
CR, LF, U+2028 and U+2029. Source spans include signatures and internal
comments/blanks, excluding preceding trivia. Named functions use lexical names;
anonymous callbacks also use occurrence order. Shell/Python/PowerShell have file
line budgets; JavaScript/TypeScript also have function/AST metrics.

The checker compares against the merge-base with the fetched PR target
(`GITHUB_BASE_REF`, restricted to `dev` or `release`) first, otherwise the newer of `origin/dev` and local `dev`
(whichever contains the other). Missing or divergent baseline refs fail closed;
fetch full history and reconcile them. CI uses `fetch-depth: 0` and verifies the
base ref. Only synthetic test repositories may explicitly opt in with
`THERMITE_HEALTH_ALLOW_NO_BASE=1`; it is ignored whenever `CI` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
is set, including empty/false values. With no baseline ref the local opt-in
compares against HEAD if it exists. If the PR base has no committed budget, the
one-time migration uses the budget committed at `merge-base(HEAD, origin/dev)`.
That budget must exist and validate in the current format; there is no upgrade,
source re-seed, local-dev fallback or PR-head fallback for this authority. The PR
base source is still measured and printed as information only. All hard invariants
use the committed dev bootstrap; the PR target still selects the reason tier.
Once release has a committed budget, comparison uses that release base normally.
Existing committed v2/v3 budgets on the normal path retain their migration rules.
Version 4 retires old sub-cap records and ignores legacy string reasons.

A grandfathered allowance follows content within its file, not a name or callback
position. The matcher hashes substantive AST-token lines without trivia and
counts **added lines = current lines minus common lines**, consuming repeated
base lines once per occurrence. At most 70 added lines are allowed, even with a
reason; pure shrinks always qualify. Matches are one-to-one: fewest added lines
first, then most common lines, exact hashes, unchanged identities and lexical
IDs as deterministic tie-breakers. Over-cap files use the same 70-line bound
with trimmed nonempty file lines. Matching cannot waive the decreasing size limit.
Base fingerprints authenticate stored locators; current fingerprints are refreshed
by `health:lower`. Unmatched bodies are new and face the global cap. A record
retires when its matched value reaches the cap or below, or its content is deleted;
`health:lower` removes it without a tombstone. Subsequent growth follows ordinary
per-item policy. A recreated body must also stay under the global cap.

| Move an allowance      | Add `moves[newIdentity] = {section, from, sha256}` in health-budget.json; section is `files` or `functions`, hash comes from `measure().fileHashes` or `bodyHashes` on the base; old identity must be absent, new bytes/normalized body must match |

A move proof transfers one identity once. A grandfathered allowance transfers at
equal or lower value; the old location leaves no tombstone. Cross-file under-cap
outlier moves also need proof. Same-file grandfathered callback shifts use content
matching. Normalized hashes preserve identifiers, strings, templates and regex
contents while dropping trivia. A copy plus an edit is not a move: the source
identity must be absent. Against dev, a reason from an earlier raise cannot
authorize later growth: its exact base/current values must match. Release
targets check ceilings, continuity, grandfathering and move validity without
per-item reason composition. Ratchet tests are in
`packages/cli/test/health-{ratchet,history,baseline,continuity,scope,release}.test.ts`.
